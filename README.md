# GrowME Nuxt Project Test 2

## House Keeping
* No br tags unless absolutely necessary (mailing addresses are an exception)
* Do not use !important unless your resetting styles from a package or plugin
* Ensure your commits are detailed in what you did, short but sweet
* Research dependencies before installing, ensure it is credible and maintained
* Minimize embeds (Is there an API for this instead?)
* Load individual assets, never load a complete library (Fontawesome and Google fonts for example)
